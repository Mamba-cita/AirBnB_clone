AIRBNB PROJECT - THE CONSOLE
INTRODUCTION
The project aims to replicate the functionality of airbnb.com through a fully working website. The Console serves as a command interpreter for data manipulation without a visual interface,facilitating development and debugging. Its functionalities include creating the data model, managing objects (creation, updating, deletion, etc.), and persisting objects to a JSON file.

The first component focuses on developing a robust storage system, which abstracts the storage and persistence of objects from the console code and the frontend and RestAPI to be developed later. This abstraction allows for easy swapping of storage types without extensive code updates.
